            <span class ="card-desription">The mushroom cap is the umbrella-like top part of the mushroom,
                 which protects the gills or pores underneath.
                  It can vary greatly in size, shape, texture,
                   and color depending on the species.
                    The cap's primary function is to support the spore-producing surface,
                     which aids in reproduction. Its texture can range from smooth to scaly,
                      and its shape can be rounded, conical, or flat as the mushroom matures.
                       The cap also serves as a shield to help protect the spores from the elements.</span>

        <span class ="card-desription">The gills of a mushroom, located underneath the cap, are thin,
             blade-like structures that radiate outward from the stem.
              These gills house the spores, which are reproductive cells.
               When mature, the spores are released from the gills, aiding in the mushroom's reproduction.
                Gills can vary in color, shape, and spacing, depending on the species,
                 and they play a crucial role in dispersing spores into the environment for propagation.</span>

        <span class ="card-desription">Spores are microscopic reproductive cells produced by fungi, including mushrooms.
             They are released from the gills, pores,
              or other spore-bearing surfaces of the mushroom and are carried by wind,
               water, or animals to new locations.
                Spores are typically single-celled and come in various shapes, sizes,
                 and colors depending on the mushroom species.
                  They play a crucial role in fungal reproduction,
                   allowing mushrooms to colonize new environments and continue their life cycle.</span>

    <div class="card-data">
        <span class ="card-desription">The mushroom veil is a thin,
             protective membrane that covers and protects the gills or pores of a young mushroom
              before it fully matures. As the mushroom grows, the veil typically breaks,
               leaving behind remnants. These remnants can form a ring (or annulus)
                around the stem or sometimes leave traces along the edge of the cap.
                 The veil helps safeguard the developing reproductive structures of the mushroom
                  until it is ready to release spores.
                   There are two main types: the partial veil (which covers the gills)
                    and the universal veil (which envelops the entire mushroom).</span>

        <span class ="card-desription">The mushroom stem, also known as the stipe,
             is the stalk-like structure that supports the cap.
              It elevates the cap above the ground,
               allowing the spores to disperse more easily into the air.
                The stem can vary in height, thickness,
                 and texture depending on the mushroom species, and it may be smooth,
                  fibrous, or covered in scales.
                   Some mushrooms have a ring or veil on the stem,
                    which is a remnant of a protective membrane that once covered the gills.
                     The stem also anchors the mushroom to its substrate.</span>

             branching filaments that make up the mycelium,
              the main vegetative part of a fungus.
               These microscopic structures grow underground or within the mushroom's
                substrate, absorbing nutrients from the environment.
                 Hyphae collectively form networks that decompose organic material,
                  helping fungi obtain energy.
                   Inside a mushroom, hyphae are densely packed, forming structures like the gills,
                    stem, and cap. Hyphae are essential for the growth and reproduction
                     of the mushroom, enabling it to colonize new areas and produce spores.</span>

              It grows underground or within organic matter, such as decaying wood or soil.
               Mycelium is responsible for absorbing nutrients by breaking down organic material,
                playing a crucial role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems.
                 Often referred to as the “root system” of the mushroom, mycelium spreads extensively,
                  allowing the fungus to colonize new areas and support
